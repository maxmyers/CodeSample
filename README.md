## Third Party Libraries
## I structured the code in a similar way to some of my personal projects. Sometimes the scope of what is needed in an app can change dramatically. Even though URLSession would have worked fine in this instance, I used Alamofire because it provides a simpler interface to more complex requests. Alamofire Image provides an easy caching mechanism and a simple API to cancel image requests both of these features are in this app.
